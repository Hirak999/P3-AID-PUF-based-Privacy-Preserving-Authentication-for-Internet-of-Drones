# P3-AID-PUF-based-Privacy-Preserving-Authentication-for-Internet-of-Drones

In recent years, drones, in particular, unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) are getting
popular in both the civil and military arena. Rapid growth in the development of
micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) has helped to integrate miniature and
low-cost sensors for control and commands for UAV stabilization. Hence secure
authentication of these UAVs is of paramount importance. Several proposals have
been proposed so far in literature to make to serve this purpose. In this work, we
review and propose novel attack methodologies for four mutual UAV authentication
protocols that utilize ARM TrustZone and Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs),
Digital Signature and a hash function, PUFs for UAV-Ground Station and UAVUAV, 
and Anonymous Attestation Scheme for Network-Connected UAVs and three
group authentication protocol featuring Flexible and Lightweight Group Authentication, 
PUF-Based Lightweight Group Authentication and Key Distribution and
Group Communication in Body Area Networks through PUF.
The first part of the thesis describes the four mutual UAV authentication schemes
with a unified notion. Second, we highlight the detected vulnerabilities to such an
extent that it cannot be supported for real-life applications. Further we propose a
direction towards the countermeasures that can be adapted by all four protocols.
Then we move on to the three group authentication protocol and mention the vulnerabilities in them. 
Finally, by overcoming all of the drawbacks of the proposed group
authentication and key distribution protocols we have designed and proposed our
improved version of key generation and distribution model for Internet of Drones.
